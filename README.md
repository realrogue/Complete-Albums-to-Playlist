## Complete Albums to Playlist

This is an app for Apple Music on macOS that will create a playlist called "Complete Albums" that contains all albums with more than 7 songs.

From there, you can use the playlist as a base, and create Smart Playlists to have all complete albums from one genre, or maybe everything minus a genre. Go wild!
